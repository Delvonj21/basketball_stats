This project is for basketball players (or anyone else) looking to keep track of their stats throughout their season. 
You simply type in your "points", "assists", "rebounds", opponent you played aganist and the date you played them. 
This will keep track of everything you need and you can also check back and see all of your games to see which were best!!
